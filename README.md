## Instruction

### Do this first - Setup a repository for interviewing

1. Create an initial commit with this starting project
2. Create a private repository in your own GitHub account
3. Push this project to that repository
4. Invite @lukyth and @moriyak as a collaborator

### About the task

We'd like you to implement a feature to a small application.
The application included in this repo shows a test scenario for E2E testing in a step-by-step style.
To make things simpler, it supports only two kinds of operation -- "Visit" some page and "Input" text to the page.

The task is to make the text to input in "Input" steps editable.

- Implement step edit panel in either `/packages/app-react` or `/packages/app-vue`
  - Choose either React.js or Vue.js and work on the corresponding starting app we provide
  - React.js is preferrable, but if you feel a lot more confident in Vue.js, you can use that as well (that's why we provide a starting project in Vue.js as well to save you some time ðŸ˜„)
- The panel should look like the design we provide
- The panel can be open when clicking on "Input" step.
- The panel should be open _below the row of the open step_. You can see an example of the interaction at `/design/example.gif`.
- When edit the text in the panel, the text in step card should also be updated
- The type of input can be changed from `Given value`, which is a free text, to `Random email address`, which is an email address generated from the api.

### What we provide

- Basic project infrastructure
- The design for the UI in `/design`
  - Open `/design/index.html` in a browser to see the inspectable design
- A page with step cards rendered
  - Step data will be fetched from the server side on page request
- An API to get a random email address

### Rules

- We'll test the website only on Chrome Stable for macOS, with the viewport size of 1280x800
- You **cannot** modify `/packages/api`
- You can add any dependency you want
- You can modify the code, or project structure, however you want
- You can reach out to us if you have any question
- We'll judge the final result based on:
  - How well the UI work, the UX when using it
  - How it being tested
  - How the code is structured, its readability
